# AdvantageScope-3044

AdvantageScope-3044 is a fork of [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope) designed for use with [OxConfig](https://github.com/FRCTeam3044/OxConfig) to allow for realtime editng/tuning of values.

For current users of AdvantageScope looking to switch for OxConfig, AdvantageScope-3044 will try to stay as up-to-date as possible with the latest AdvantageScope features. It is currently a drop-in replacement, just adding the additional features. There is in-app documentation for the tuner and Config Editor, and it is available in the online documentation.

AdvantageScope is a robot diagnostics, log review/analysis, and data visualization application for FIRST Robotics Competition teams. It reads logs in WPILOG, DS log, and RLOG file formats, plus live robot data viewing using NT4 or RLOG streaming. AdvantageScope can be used with any WPILib project, but is also optimized for use with our [AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit) logging framework.

It includes the following tools:

- A Config Editor/Tuner system designed for use with OxConfig
- A wide selection of flexible graphs and charts
- 2D and 3D field visualizations of odometry data, with customizable CAD-based robots
- Synchronized video playback from a separately loaded match video
- Joystick visualization, showing driver actions on customizable controller representations
- Swerve drive module vector displays
- Console message review
- Log statistics analysis
- Flexible export options, with support for CSV and WPILOG
